Exercise 7  - Swagger (Page 66)

Part 2: Add an express back-end to the Fake Store API exercise from Module 4. Your back end should use routes and controller functions to handle fetching the Fake Store data, and your front end should fetch from your back-end instead of directly from the Fake Store back end. Include these routes in your swagger.json config.


SINCE I DID NOT USE A FAKE API, I APPLIED THE SAME CONCEPT TO THE INTERNAL DATA AND CREATED AN API WITH THE REQUIRED MVC STRUCTURE.

HOWEVER, ANOTHER VERSION OF IT IS AVAILABLE USING A FAKE API AS REQUESTED TO FETCH EXTERNAL DATA
